                <h1>1. Detection and Classification of Animals using Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h1>
                <h2>International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET), January 2023</h2>

                <h2>Abstract: Human-Animal Conflict is a major problem where
                    an enormous number of resources is lost, and human life is in
                    danger. So, it is necessary to continuously monitor and prevent
                    animal intrusion. We aim to develop an animal detection and
                    identification system from images taken through monitoring
                    videos captured by motion-triggered cameras, called cameratraps. For these types of videos, existing approaches often
                    super from low detection rates due to low contrast between
                    the foreground animals and the cluttered background, as well
                    as high false-positive rates due to the dynamic background. To
                    address this issue, we will first develop an approach to
                    generate animal object region proposals using Advanced
                    Image Processing and then apply Artificial Intelligence
                    techniques to detect and classify the animal. We aim to
                    implement the animal detection and identification steps using
                    the following techniques: eXtreme Gradient Boosting
                    (XGBoost), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Convolutional
                    Neural Network (CNN). We first determine if these region
                    proposals are true animals or background patches. We then
                    identify animals using the above algorithms. This Animal
                    Detection System can be used in a variety of applications like:
                    Animal Intrusion Detection in Industries set up in forest areas
                    / remote location, in residential areas, Agriculture fields and
                    to avoid Animal-Vehicle collisions
